### Description

Online chat-based counselling has long lacked the same effectiveness as classical face-to-face counselling due to shortages in experienced personnel, such as counsellors and facilitators. This was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its resultant lockdowns, when online counselling was the only way for many to receive reliable counselling.

Hover is a web-based companion for chat-based counselling sessions. It analyses the message content from a patient in a chat-based counselling exchange and helps guide the counsellor/facilitator by flagging keywords, providing therapy suggestions, detecting phrase repetition, detecting message correctness and detecting spikes or drops in typing speed.

This is a mock chat application for showcasing the capabilities of Hover, built using **ReactJS**, **NodeJS** and the **WebSockets** protocol.
